A library to check when the bottom side of the browser reaches an element
and then add a class to this element to apply visual effects -animation- when reached

Originally was made to make the shown-content-onReached effect 

all you have to do is to call the function wessal
that takes two parameters the element and the class name 

wassal( element, className)


//wassal is the Arabic equivalent of (got there) or (reached)
